Python is a wonderful general purpose language for any kind of development, and particularily good for tool scripting, data-analysis and AI-development.

# A recent tool I'm excited about:

Technologies: Anki, Autohotkey, Python: PIL, WIN32Clipboard

- Automatically darkening(inverting) screencaptured images on the clipboard by pressing a hotkey e.g. Win+Shift+A
- Why - easily creating study cards that can be viewed in the evening.
- Bright images with white backgrounds hurt the eyes and sleep in the later hours of the day.
- Phone night time filters aren't able to dim pure white and bright colors enough, so it's necessary to create dark cards to begin with.
